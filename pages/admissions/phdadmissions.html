						<b>Overview</b><br>
						<p>The Department of AI is a newly launched department at IIT Hyderabad. Considering the
							interdisciplinary nature of AI, a separate department helps in creating a complete ecosystem for AI Academics and Research at
							IIT Hyderabad. The department will offer B.Tech, M.Tech. and PhD programs, and plans to offer a variety of Minor Programs in
							AI. The emergence of the department is the consequence of the heavy demand from the industry on artificial intelligence and
							data analytics, and the need to tackle the many fundamental and foundational research problems arising in a rapidly evolving
							field. The departmentâ€™s mission is to
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Train students to have a sound understanding of the fundamentals of the theory and practise
								of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</li>
							<li>Enable students to become leaders in the industry and academia nationally and
								internationally.</li>
							<li>Meet the pressing demands of the nation in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Machine
								Learning.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							The Department of Artificial Intelligence has a sizable number of highly dedicated and dynamic
							faculty members, with a wide variety of expertise. Currently there are 22 faculty members affiliated with the AI department.
							Candidates can discover the profiles and teaching/research areas of different faculty members by visiting
							<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/pages/people/faculty.html" target="_blank">Faculty Profiles</a>
						</p>

						<p>The PhD students will be provided with excellent laboratory facilities that they can access at any
							time. The laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art facilities including software and hardware (including high-end GPU
							servers). All the laboratories are provided with internet connectivity.
