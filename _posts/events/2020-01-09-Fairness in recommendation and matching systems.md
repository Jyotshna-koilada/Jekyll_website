**Abstract:**

Algorithmic (data-driven) decision making is increasingly being used to assist or replace human decision making in domains with
high societal impact, such as banking (estimating creditworthiness), recruiting (ranking applicants), judiciary (offender 
profiling) and journalism (recommending news-stories). Consequently, in recent times, multiple research works have attempted 
to identify (measure) bias or unfairness in algorithmic decisions and proposed mechanisms to control (mitigate) such biases. 
However, the emphasis of existing works has been on fairness in supervised classification or regression tasks, and fairness 
issues in other scenarios remain relatively unexplored. In this talk, I’ll cover our recent works on fairness in recommendation
and matching systems, where the algorithms need to fairly consider the preferences of multiple sides. I’ll introduce the notions
of fairness in these contexts and propose techniques to achieve them. Additionally, I’ll briefly touch upon the possibility of
utilizing user interface of platforms (choice architecture) to achieve fair outcomes in certain scenarios. I’ll conclude the talk
with a list of open questions and directions for future work
