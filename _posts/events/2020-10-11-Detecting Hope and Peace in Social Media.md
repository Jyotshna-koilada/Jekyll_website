**Abstract:**

Text analyses in the Indian subcontinent present unique challenges. Content is authored in a variety of low-resource languages and 
exhibits high levels of code-switching. In this talk, we will discuss recent case studies that introduce elegant, low-supervision 
methods to address the linguistic diversity in user-authored Indian web content. Our case studies include the Rohingya refugee 
crisis, and the 2019 India/Pakistan conflict. We explore two new tasks - help speech detection and hope speech detection to surface
de-escalating, positive content and explore active learning pipelines to address class imbalance. The associated papers were 
selected for oral presentations at AAAI 2020, and ECAI 2020

**Speaker Profile:**

Shriphani Palakodety, a researcher-cum-engineer at Onai (California, USA), has developed low-resource NLP methods for a variety 
of computational social science problems based in the Indian subcontinent, designed some of the first neural information retrieval 
techniques, and developed techniques at the intersection of Zero-Knowledge proofs and formal methods. His work in these areas has 
been featured in several leading press outlets. He earned an MS from Carnegie Mellon University, and a BS from Purdue University. 
He has designed and taught popular courses in deep learning, and blockchain at San Jose State University. In addition to research, 
Shriphani runs one of Indiaâ€™s most popular data-visualization websites. His work has been featured in leading Indian press outlets
