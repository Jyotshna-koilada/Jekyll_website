**Abstract**

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become the driving force behind the recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) success. Adversarial 
perturbations are the small but structured additive noise that can make the DNNs unstable. In this talk I demonstrate simple 
yet very effective approaches to craft input-agnostic (Universal) adversarial perturbations that can confuse the DNN classifiers.
More specifically, first I will show that it is possible to fool these models via encouraging them to behave approximately 
linearly. Because of the generic nature of this objective, we can observe its effectiveness to fool DNNs trained across multiple 
Computer Vision applications even in the data-free environment. After convincing that there exist easier ways to craft 
input-agnostic adversarial perturbations, I will discuss our attempts to find the scale of such perturbations for one or an 
ensemble of DNN classifiers. More specifically, I will take you through the pool of such perturbations captured by our generative 
model. This adversarially trained GAN-like generative framework can learn the manifold of such perturbations and paints a bigger 
picture about the DNN’s vulnerability. I will conclude with the interesting directions possible from our findings in the space 
of models’ robustness. In the end, I will briefly discuss my recent research work related to the adaptability of DNNs<
